_* needs a look: see below._

## Needs a look (imported)

1. **gRPC users (gRPC) → grpc-users**  
   It uses the standard gRPC health check instead of a keyword match.
2. **Old site (paused) (HTTP) → old-site-paused**  
   It was paused in Uptime Kuma, so it is imported paused.  
   To do: Resume it when you want it checked.
3. **Tailscale node (Ping) → tailscale-node**  
   It is pinged directly, not through Tailscale.  
   To do: Run Unagikuma (or a probe node) on a machine in your tailnet if the name only resolves there.
4. **Channel "Team Slack" → team-slack**  
   Messages go to the webhook's own channel; the channel override (#alerts) is not used.
5. **Channel "Generic webhook" → generic-webhook**  
   The message body differs from Uptime Kuma's.  
   To do: Check that the receiving side understands it (Alerting › Channels › Test).
6. **Channel "Webhook custom body" → webhook-custom-body**  
   The message body differs from Uptime Kuma's. Its custom body template was not carried over (the template language differs).  
   To do: Check that the receiving side understands it (Alerting › Channels › Test). Write the body again under Alerting › Channels (body=).
7. **Channel "Ops email" → ops-email**  
   Copy (CC/BCC) addresses are sent to as normal recipients.

## Not imported

1. **Minecraft server (Game server)**  
   Why: Unagikuma has no game-server query.  
   To do: Check the server's port with a TCP or UDP monitor.
2. **Mongo (MongoDB)**  
   Why: Unagikuma has no MongoDB check.  
   To do: Check port 27017 with a TCP monitor, or run a script check (EXEC).
3. **MQTT sensors (MQTT)**  
   Why: Unagikuma has no MQTT check.  
   To do: Check the broker port with a TCP monitor, or have the device call a push URL (a Push monitor).
4. **MSSQL (SQL Server)**  
   Why: Unagikuma has no SQL Server check.  
   To do: Check port 1433 with a TCP monitor, or run a script check (EXEC).
5. **Old host must be down (HTTP)**  
   Why: It is in upside-down mode (it is up when the service is down). Unagikuma has no such mode, so it would report the opposite.  
   To do: If you still need it, add it by hand as a normal check and decide what “up” should mean.
6. **RADIUS (RADIUS)**  
   Why: Unagikuma cannot log in to RADIUS.  
   To do: Check that the server answers with a UDP monitor on port radius (1812).
7. **Steam game server (Steam game server)**  
   Why: Unagikuma has no Steam server query.  
   To do: Check the server's port with a TCP or UDP monitor.
8. **Group "Empty group"**  
   Why: The group has no monitors that were imported.  
   To do: Nothing to do: groups appear here as soon as a monitor uses them (group=).
9. **Channels: Pushover (Pushover), Teams (Microsoft Teams), Gotify (Gotify), PagerDuty (PagerDuty), Unused Matrix (Matrix)**  
   Why: No imported monitor uses them.  
   To do: Add them under Alerting › Channels if you still need them.

## Good to know

- Past checks, uptime history and incidents stay in Uptime Kuma: history starts fresh here.
- Credentials (tokens, passwords, webhook addresses) are stored as encrypted secrets, not in the configuration file.
- A JSON backup has no accounts, maintenance windows or status pages. To bring those too, import kuma.db instead (it is in Uptime Kuma's data folder).
